# What is the List?
- List is linear data structure that can insert and remove element in every list location.
- Unlike stack and queue, List can insert and remove element in location that is not `first(left)` or `rear(right)`.
- In principle, the concept of the List does not have its size limit, but it depends on how is implemented.
- Imagine you have to-do list, suddenly you have to add new work `C` between `A` and `B`. It's List's characteristic. It is possible to insert and delete anywhere.
