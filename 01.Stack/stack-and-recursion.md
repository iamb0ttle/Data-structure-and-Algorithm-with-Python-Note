# Stack And Recursion
- Stack is related with recursion very deeply.
- When recursion call happens, recursion call is pushed 'call stack'.
- Recursion call is popped from call stack when they return or end function.
- For instance, computer's memory architecture has 'stack' field that store function call and variable definitions records as LIFO.
