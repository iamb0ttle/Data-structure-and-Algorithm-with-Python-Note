# Deque
- Deque is the queue can insert and remove element from both `front(left)` and `rear(right)`. 
- But still can't insert and remove element from middle(is not front or rear).
- This is easy, if you think that stack and queue is integrated.
- To prevent Queue's general problem, deque is also commonly implemented by circular queue.
