# Expression Tree
- Expression Tree is Tree structure to contain math expression.
- Node is consist of only **operand** and **operator**. 
- Expression Tree is usually using for expressions post, pre and in-order transformation.
- For computer, some brackets and pre-order expression is only for human. For an efficient operation, computer likes non-brackets post-order expression.
- Only leaf node is operand, and non-leaf node is operator. So, we can process easily these tree nodes following this rule.
