# Tree Terminologies
- In Tree Structure, there is many terminologies to express constituents.
- First, we have to know Tree primary terms.
    - **Node**: container to store one data. It is doesn't matter, whether you think data itself.
    - **Edge**: It express each node's connection relationship.
- Other Tree Terminologies 
| Term | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Root Node** | It is located at the top of the tree. |
| **Parent Node** | In this edge-connected relationship, this is the parent node. |
| **Child Node** | In this edge-connected relationship, this is the children node. |
| **Sibling Node** | It is node that has same parent node. |
| **Ancestor Node** | It is all of nodes that locate in path until root node. |
| **Descendent Node** | It is all of nodes that are connected as children node from specific node. |
| **Leaf Node** | It is node that doesn't have child node. |
| **Degree** | It is number of child nodes count. Leaf Node's degree always 0. |
| **Tree's Degree** | Biggest degree in Tree. |
| **Level** | It is number to differentiate each layer. |
| **Height** | Distance of until leaf node from specific node. |
| **Sub Tree** | Another Tree that deem specific node as root node in Tree. |
