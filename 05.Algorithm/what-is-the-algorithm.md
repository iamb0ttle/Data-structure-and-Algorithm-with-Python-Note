# What Is The Algorithm?
- Algorithm is the set what commands will excuted by order.
- Algorithm has to follow these principels. If even one rule does not apply, it is not an algorithm.
    - **Input**: Algorithm's input have to definite.
    - **Output**: Algorithm must have over one output.
    - **Clarity**: Every commands in the algorithm must be definite, not ambiguous.
    - **Finiteness**: Algorithm must have definite end point.
    - **Language Independence**: Algorithm must not apply only to a specific language. Algorithm can be implemented in any other language.
    - **Viability**: All commands in the algorithm must be technically executable.
