# The Way To Express Algorithms
- To express algorithm, here is many ways.
- Represntative ways to express algorithms are '**Natural Language**', '**Flow Chart**', '**Programming Code**' and '**Pseudo Code**'.

### Natural Language
- This way is to express algorithm process as natural language by order.
- Most simple way, and everyone can understand even if doesn't know about programming.
- However, if the algorithm is complicated or long, it can be difficult to understand.

### Flow Chart

- This way is to express algorithm as flow chart that has many shapes according to situations.
- Easier to apprehend visually than natural language.
- It is easy to understand even if algorithm is complicated. And also everyone can understand even if doesn't know about programming.
- But flow chart also can be difficult to understand if algorithm be long.

### Programming Code
- This way is to express algorithm as specific programming language that implemented algorithm.
- Most clear way to express algorithm.
- But it can be difficult to understand if seer doesn't know written programming code syntax
- Depending to programming language, expression complexity can be increased. For example, to express find max value in array, C Lang have to write over 10 lines code at least. But Python can solve just one line by using `max()` function. This is why python is suit as language to express algorithm.

### Pseudo Code
- This way is to express algorithm as pseudo code.
- Pseudocode is like a programming code structure, but because it is abstract, it is easy to understand even if you don't know a specific programming language.
- It isn't confined to specific programming language.
- To understand pseudocode, seer have to know it's syntax. But syntax is very natural and easy to understand.
